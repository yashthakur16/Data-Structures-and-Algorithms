# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms repository. This repository contains my documented practice and solutions for various data structure and algorithm problems from platforms like LeetCode, Coding Ninjas, and Geeks for Geeks, with a focus on linear data structures.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Solutions**: Includes solutions to a variety of problems from popular coding platforms.
- **Focused Study**: Emphasizes linear data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
- **Well-Documented**: Each solution is well-documented to facilitate understanding and learning.
- **Diverse Techniques**: Demonstrates different algorithms and problem-solving techniques.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Git
- A C++ compiler (like GCC or Clang)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms.git
    cd Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
    ```

## Usage

Navigate through the directory to find solutions to specific problems. Each file is named according to the problem it solves.

### Example Files

- `Add Two numbers represented by linked list.cpp`: Solution for adding two numbers represented by linked lists.
- `Binary Search`: Solutions related to binary search algorithms.
